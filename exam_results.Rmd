```
```{r}
setwd("D:C:\Users\OneDrive - University of Bergen\PhD_88\Courses\R_Autumn21\exam_")
myData <- ("flights")
```

```{r}
Write a short code that would find:

    a) flights that arrived more than two hours late, but didnâ€™t leave late
    b) the most delayed flights.
```
```{r}

```

```{r}
3. What does this code do?
  It summarizes delay by year month and day.
```

```{r}
data("mpg")

ggplot(mpg, aes(class)) + geom_histogram(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = "bin",
                                         position = "stack", class,binwidth = NULL, 
                                         bins = NULL, na.rm = FALSE, orientation = NA, 
                                         show.legend = NA, 
                                         inherit.aes = TRUE)
